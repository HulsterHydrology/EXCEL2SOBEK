# EXCEL2SOBEK v2.85

This repository contains an Excel macro tool (`.xlsm`) that exports data to SOBEK model input files.  
It was originally developed by **Siebe Bosch (Hydroconsult)**. I did not create this tool myself, I am only sharing it here so others in the hydrology/hydraulic modelling community can use it.

## Features
- Exports Excel tables into SOBEK input files (e.g. `struct.dat`, `friction.dat`, â€¦).
- Automates data checks and file creation.
- Provides a user interface within Excel with macro buttons.

## Usage
1. Open the `.xlsm` file in Microsoft Excel (enable macros).
2. Fill in the input tables.
3. Use the provided buttons to export SOBEK input files.
